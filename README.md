## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you want to add new content, fix a bug, or suggest an improvement, follow these steps to contribute:

1. **Clone** the repository.
2. **Create a branch** for your feature or fix: `git checkout -b feature/YourFeatureName`.
3. **Commit** your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`.
4. **Push** to the branch: `git push origin feature/YourFeatureName`.
5. **Create a Pull Request** to the `main` branch.

There will be a check to make sure that npm run build:dev successfully runs locally, before any pushes can be made. Please do not disable the git hook that does this, as this is intentional to prevent failing builds.
