## Your Character's Class

Each class has their place in the game, offering unique abilities, playstyles, and roleplaying opportunities. While this article is meant to provide a better framework for understanding each class, it's important to remember that you ultimately have control over how you play your character. Most GM's are open to creative interpretations of class abilities, so feel free to reflavor classes and their ability descriptions to better fit your character concept.

Let's dive into each class in more detail:

## Barbarian

- **Complexity**: Low
- **Spellcaster**: No
- **Primary Attributes**: Strength, Constitution
- **Combat Role**: Frontline melee

> Barbarians are fierce, primal warriors who channel their inner rage to become devastating forces on the battlefield. Their primary ability, **Rage**, allows them to increase their damage output while taking less damage from physical attacks. This makes them ideal for players who want to be at the front lines, dealing and taking hits while relying on their sheer toughness and strength.

#### Rage

> When a Barbarian enters a rage, they become much harder to kill and significantly stronger in combat. This ability is often the hallmark of the class, giving them temporary bonuses to damage, resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and advantage on Strength-based checks and saving throws. Rage typically lasts for a minute or until the Barbarian isn't attacking or being attacked. Your subclass likely will enhance your rage in some way, such as surrounding yourself with a protective storm or creating magical effects when you enter a rage.

#### When to Choose This Class

> If you enjoy straightforward, physical combat and the idea of becoming a nearly unstoppable force in battle, the Barbarian is an excellent choice. It’s perfect for players who want to focus on brute strength and survivability without getting bogged down by complex abilities or spells. Barbarians excel in campaigns where there’s a lot of combat and the party needs a durable character to soak up damage.

#### About Barbarians

- **Common Lore**: Barbarians are often depicted as coming from tribal or nomadic backgrounds, with a deep respect for nature and a strong code of honor. They might be seen as wild, untamed warriors who rely on instincts rather than tactics. In many stories, Barbarians value personal strength, honor in battle, and loyalty to their tribe or companions. Their rage might stem from deep emotional pain or a connection to primal forces.
- **Roleplay**: Players often play Barbarians as simple-minded or overly aggressive, acting first and asking questions later. This stereotype is sometimes reinforced by the class's focus on physical prowess over intellect. However, more nuanced characters can also emphasize a Barbarian’s loyalty, sense of justice, or complex internal struggles behind their rage. Some players enjoy the class because it allows them to play a straightforward, easy-to-learn combat role.

## Bard

- **Complexity**: High
- **Spellcaster**: Yes
- **Primary Attributes**: Charisma, Dexterity
- **Combat Role**: Support, Spellcasting, Versatility, Utility

> Bards are charismatic and versatile spellcasters who draw on their performance skills, creativity, and wit to influence the world around them. With access to a wide range of spells and abilities, Bards can fill nearly any role in a party—whether it's as a healer, support, or even a frontline fighter. Their primary feature, **Bardic Inspiration**, allows them to empower their allies by boosting their ability to succeed on important rolls.

#### Bardic Inspiration

> Bards inspire those around them by performing music, poetry, or other artistic displays. With Bardic Inspiration, a Bard can grant an ally a special die (usually a d6 at lower levels) that can be added to an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. This ability recharges on a short or long rest and scales with level, allowing the Bard to provide consistent support throughout combat or challenging situations. Depending on the Bard’s subclass, Bardic Inspiration can also gain additional effects, such as granting new attack options or granting your allies a speed boost.

#### When to Choose This Class

> If you enjoy having a wide range of options, both in and out of combat, the Bard is a fantastic choice. With access to spells, weapons, and the ability to inspire your allies, you’ll never feel stuck in a single role. The Bard excels in parties that need a flexible character who can switch between roles—whether it's healing, buffing, debuffing, or casting powerful spells. Bards also shine in social encounters, as their high Charisma makes them natural leaders, negotiators, and entertainers.

#### About Bards

- **Common Lore**: Bards are often portrayed as traveling performers, spreading stories, songs, and magic across the land. They are deeply connected to the power of words and music, using their craft to influence events and inspire those around them. In many tales, Bards are known for their charm, cleverness, and ability to get out of tricky situations using their wits rather than brute strength. While some Bards might come from formal schools or colleges of magic, others are self-taught, relying on their natural talent and creativity.
- **Roleplay**: Bards can be played as charming tricksters, silver-tongued diplomats, or even as noble scholars of art and history. Their flexibility allows players to explore many different personality types, from the wandering minstrel who lives for adventure to the suave courtier who uses their talents for political gain. The Bard’s wide range of spells and abilities can also make for exciting roleplay opportunities, especially in campaigns that focus on intrigue, diplomacy, or performance. Because Bards are jacks-of-all-trades, they appeal to players who enjoy versatility and creativity in both roleplaying and combat.

## Cleric

- **Complexity**: High
- **Spellcaster**: Yes
- **Primary Attributes**: Wisdom, Constitution
- **Combat Role**: Support, Healing, Spellcasting, Frontline (sometimes)

> Clerics are divine spellcasters who draw power from their chosen deity to protect and heal their allies, while also wielding potent offensive magic. With access to a wide variety of spells and the ability to wear heavier armor, Clerics are incredibly versatile in combat. Their primary ability, **Channel Divinity**, allows them to call upon the power of their god for miraculous effects, which vary depending on the Cleric’s domain (subclass).

#### Channel Divinity

> Channel Divinity is a signature ability that allows Clerics to perform powerful divine feats. Every Cleric has access to the **Turn Undead** ability, which forces nearby undead creatures to flee from the Cleric’s divine presence. Additionally, each domain (subclass) grants unique Channel Divinity options, such as restoring hit points to allies, or dealing extra damage by empowering a spell. This feature recharges after a short or long rest, making it a reliable tool in the Cleric’s arsenal.

#### When to Choose This Class

> If you enjoy playing a character with a strong connection to a higher power, and want to balance healing, support, and offense, the Cleric is an excellent choice. Clerics are particularly valuable in parties that need a dedicated healer or support character, but they’re also capable of dealing damage and holding their own in combat. With a large selection of spells and subclass options, Clerics can be tailored to suit many playstyles—whether you want to focus on healing, damage, or crowd control.

#### About Clerics

- **Common Lore**: Clerics are often portrayed as devout followers of a specific god or deity, acting as their emissaries in the world. Their faith is unshakable, and they perform miracles on behalf of their chosen deity, ranging from healing the wounded to smiting enemies with divine wrath. Clerics come from many walks of life, and their powers are often viewed with awe and reverence by those they encounter. Their role as intermediaries between the mortal world and the divine gives them a strong sense of purpose and responsibility.
- **Roleplay**: Clerics can be played as pious and stoic individuals who always act according to the will of their deity, or as more free-spirited followers who interpret their god’s will in their own way. Their connection to the divine often influences their worldview, giving them strong moral codes or unique perspectives on life and death. In roleplaying, a Cleric’s faith and relationship with their deity can be a rich source of conflict or motivation, whether they are seeking to spread their god’s teachings, maintain order, or challenge the forces of evil. This class appeals to players who enjoy themes of devotion, righteousness, and spiritual power.

## Druid

- **Complexity**: High
- **Spellcaster**: Yes
- **Primary Attributes**: Wisdom, Constitution
- **Combat Role**: Spellcasting, Support, Versatility, Shape-shifting

> Druids are mystical spellcasters with a deep connection to nature, drawing their power from the natural world to shape-shift, heal, and control the elements. Their ability to transform into animals with **Wild Shape** and their access to a wide array of nature-based spells make Druids one of the most versatile classes in the game. Whether it’s controlling the battlefield with elemental forces or healing allies with the power of nature, Druids can adapt to nearly any situation.

#### Wild Shape

> Druids can use their Wild Shape ability to transform into beasts they have seen before, allowing them to take on new forms that grant increased mobility, strength, or stealth. Wild Shape is a signature feature of the Druid, providing them with combat options, utility, and escape mechanisms. At higher levels, Druids can turn into more powerful creatures and eventually become immune to aging and the need for food or water. Subclasses like the Circle of the Moon make Wild Shape even more central to the Druid’s playstyle, enhancing its combat capabilities. You can also choose to subclass into other circles, such as the Circle of the Land, which focuses on spellcasting and nature magic, or Circle of Spores, which emphasizes necrotic damage and control.

#### When to Choose This Class

> If you enjoy the idea of protecting nature and want to have both spellcasting and the ability to shapeshift into powerful animals, the Druid is an excellent choice. Druids are perfect for players who want flexibility, as they can fill multiple roles—whether as healers, damage dealers, or controllers—while also maintaining a connection to the natural world. The class shines in wilderness-heavy campaigns, where their nature-based abilities and spells allow them to navigate the environment with ease and offer significant advantages.

#### About Druids

- **Common Lore**: Druids are often seen as the guardians of nature, dedicated to preserving the balance between the natural world and civilization. They are typically portrayed as reclusive or nomadic, living close to the land and communing with animals and plants. In many cultures, Druids hold positions of respect as wise mystics, able to control the weather, influence crops, and heal both people and animals. Their power is drawn from nature itself, and they view themselves as protectors of the cycle of life and death.
- **Roleplay**: Druids can be played as wise and serene individuals with a deep understanding of the natural world, or as fierce protectors of the wild, quick to defend nature from those who would harm it. Their ability to transform into animals provides many opportunities for unique roleplay moments, such as spying on enemies in the form of a small bird or charging into battle as a ferocious beast. Druids are also often conflicted between their love of nature and their place in the world of civilization, making them intriguing characters to roleplay. This class appeals to players who enjoy themes of balance, nature, and transformation.

## Fighter

- **Complexity**: Low
- **Spellcaster**: Optional (Eldritch Knight Subclass)
- **Primary Attributes**: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution
- **Combat Role**: Very versatile, can be a tank, damage dealer, or skirmisher (ranged or melee)

> Fighters are masters of combat, specializing in a wide array of weapons and fighting styles. Whether you want to be a heavily armored tank, a nimble archer, or a versatile weapon master, the Fighter class provides the flexibility to shape your character into any type of physical combatant. Their signature ability, **Action Surge**, gives them an extra action during combat, allowing them to deal devastating damage or perform additional maneuvers when needed.

#### Action Surge

> Action Surge allows a Fighter to take an additional action on their turn, effectively doubling their attack output or allowing them to take strategic actions when they need them most. This ability recharges after a short or long rest, making it a powerful tool that can turn the tide of battle. Fighters also gain more uses of Action Surge as they level up, ensuring that they remain effective in long encounters or multiple combat scenarios. Action Surge, combined with your Multi-Attack feature, makes Fighters one of the most consistent damage dealers in the game.

#### When to Choose This Class

> If you want to play a character who is highly customizable and focused on physical combat, the Fighter is a strong choice. Fighters excel in campaigns that feature a lot of combat, as they can dish out consistent damage and serve as reliable defenders. With access to a variety of fighting styles and the ability to wear heavy armor or wield two weapons, Fighters can be tailored to fit almost any combat role. They are ideal for players who want to master the art of combat without the complexity of spellcasting (unless you choose the Eldritch Knight archetype).

#### About Fighters

- **Common Lore**: Fighters are often depicted as professional soldiers, mercenaries, or gladiators. They can come from any background, from noble knights trained in chivalry to streetwise brawlers who learned to fight out of necessity. Fighters are pragmatic, relying on their skills and discipline to win battles rather than magic or divine intervention. Their focus on physical prowess, tactics, and raw power makes them formidable opponents and respected warriors in most societies.
- **Roleplay**: Fighters can be played as disciplined warriors with a strict code of honor or as grizzled veterans who have seen too many battles. Their motivations are often tied to personal glory, loyalty to a cause, or a desire to perfect their combat skills. Fighters can be found in any setting, whether it's a battlefield, an arena, or a tavern brawl, making them versatile characters with rich potential for roleplay. This class is great for players who enjoy straightforward, no-nonsense combat and want to explore themes of honor, discipline, or survival.

## Monk

- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Spellcaster**: No
- **Primary Attributes**: Dexterity, Wisdom
- **Combat Role**: Melee, Mobility, Control

> Monks are agile martial artists who harness the power of their inner energy, known as **ki**, to perform incredible feats of combat and mobility. Monks excel in close-quarters combat, relying on speed and precision rather than heavy armor or brute strength. Their signature abilities allow them to strike multiple times in rapid succession, move with supernatural speed, and deflect incoming attacks, making them elusive and deadly on the battlefield.

#### Ki

> Ki is the Monk’s core resource, representing their inner spiritual energy. Monks can use their ki to fuel a variety of powerful abilities, such as **Flurry of Blows**, which allows them to make extra unarmed strikes after attacking, **Step of the Wind**, which enhances their mobility, and **Patient Defense**, which boosts their ability to dodge incoming attacks. As Monks progress in levels, they gain access to even more ki-powered abilities, such as stunning foes or deflecting missiles. Ki regenerates after a short or long rest, allowing Monks to continue using their powerful abilities throughout the adventuring day.

#### When to Choose This Class

> If you like the idea of playing a fast, agile warrior who relies on precise strikes and evasive maneuvers rather than brute force, the Monk is an excellent choice. Monks are ideal for players who want to be highly mobile in combat, able to dart in and out of melee while delivering powerful unarmed attacks. With their ability to dodge, deflect, and stun enemies, Monks are particularly effective in combat-heavy campaigns where speed and precision are vital. Monks also excel in campaigns that emphasize martial arts, spirituality, or themes of inner strength.

#### About Monks

- **Common Lore**: Monks are often depicted as reclusive warriors who train their bodies and minds to achieve perfection. Many come from monasteries or schools where they learn ancient techniques passed down through generations. Monks typically follow a strict code of discipline, focusing on meditation, physical training, and spiritual enlightenment. Their connection to ki is often seen as a form of self-mastery, allowing them to push beyond the limits of ordinary mortals. Monks are respected for their dedication, though they may be viewed as distant or enigmatic by those outside their order.
- **Roleplay**: Monks offer rich opportunities for roleplaying as characters on a path of self-discovery and discipline. Some players choose to portray Monks as serene and wise, always in control of their emotions and actions. Others may play Monks as fierce warriors driven by a sense of justice or revenge. The Monk’s focus on physical and spiritual discipline can lead to interesting internal conflicts, as they strive to balance their emotions with their training. Monks fit well in campaigns that explore themes of personal growth, discipline, or the pursuit of enlightenment, making them a compelling choice for players who enjoy character development alongside physical prowess.

## Paladin

- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Spellcaster**: Yes (Limited)
- **Primary Attributes**: Strength, Charisma
- **Combat Role**: Frontline, Tank, Support, Healing

> Paladins are holy warriors bound by a sacred oath, combining martial prowess with divine magic. They are the embodiment of righteousness and justice, standing as defenders of the weak and destroyers of evil. Paladins are formidable in combat, capable of dealing significant damage while also healing and protecting their allies. Their signature ability, **Divine Smite**, allows them to channel divine power into their attacks to deal devastating radiant damage to their foes.

#### Divine Smite

> Divine Smite is the Paladin’s defining combat feature, enabling them to expend a spell slot to deal extra radiant damage on a melee attack. This makes Paladins deadly against both mundane and supernatural enemies, especially creatures like undead and fiends. Divine Smite scales with the level of the spell slot expended, meaning Paladins can deliver massive bursts of damage when needed. Combined with their ability to cast spells, this gives Paladins an excellent balance between martial and magical power.

#### When to Choose This Class

> If you like the idea of playing a righteous warrior who combines strong melee combat with divine powers, the Paladin is an ideal choice. Paladins are perfect for players who enjoy being on the front lines, protecting their allies, and smiting evil. Their healing abilities, defensive spells, and auras make them invaluable in campaigns with a lot of combat, especially against enemies who rely on dark magic or evil intentions. Paladins shine in parties that need a strong tank or support character who can also deal significant damage.

#### About Paladins

- **Common Lore**: Paladins are often depicted as champions of good, sworn to uphold their sacred oaths at all costs. They might follow gods of justice, protection, or honor, though some Paladins draw their strength from their dedication to ideals rather than deities. Paladins are known for their unwavering resolve and commitment to their cause, often traveling the land to vanquish evil and right wrongs. In many cultures, Paladins are seen as paragons of virtue, though they may sometimes struggle with the weight of their oaths.
- **Roleplay**: Paladins can be roleplayed as stoic champions of justice, fiercely loyal to their oath and driven by a sense of duty. However, they don’t always have to be rigid or inflexible—some Paladins wrestle with the moral complexities of their oath, giving them internal struggles that are ripe for exploration. Whether they are on a quest for redemption, pursuing a divine mission, or standing as a protector of the innocent, Paladins often find themselves torn between the letter of their oath and the spirit of it. This class appeals to players who enjoy themes of duty, morality, and divine purpose, as well as those who want to lead the charge in both combat and narrative.

## Ranger

Their signature ability, **Favored Enemy**, allows them to gain special advantages against certain types of foes, making them especially deadly when hunting their chosen prey.

#### Favored Enemy

> Rangers have extensive knowledge of specific types of creatures, giving them bonuses when tracking, hunting, or fighting those enemies. Favored Enemy grants the Ranger advantages in skills like survival and perception when dealing with their chosen enemy type. This ability can also expand at higher levels to include additional types of enemies. Depending on the Ranger’s subclass, their Favored Enemy ability may evolve to give them extra damage or other advantages in combat when facing their most-hated foes.

#### When to Choose This Class

> If you enjoy the idea of playing a skilled survivalist who excels in outdoor exploration and ranged combat, the Ranger is a great choice. Rangers are perfect for players who want to be effective at both damage-dealing and exploring the wilderness. Their unique features, such as spellcasting and tracking, make them highly versatile in campaigns that involve a lot of travel, survival, and encounters with beasts or monsters. Rangers are well-suited for parties that need a reliable scout, sniper, or nature-based spellcaster.

#### About Rangers

- **Common Lore**: Rangers are often depicted as solitary wanderers, protecting the borders between civilization and the wild. They might be guardians of the forest, tracking down dangerous creatures or guiding travelers through treacherous lands. Rangers are skilled hunters, often bonding with animals and having a deep respect for nature. In many stories, Rangers are portrayed as stoic and self-reliant, preferring the company of animals or the solitude of the wilderness to the bustle of cities. Their expertise in tracking and survival makes them invaluable in harsh environments.
- **Roleplay**: Rangers can be roleplayed as quiet and observant, always thinking two steps ahead when it comes to survival and tracking enemies. Some Rangers are driven by a personal vendetta against a specific type of enemy, while others see themselves as protectors of nature or the downtrodden. The bond Rangers form with animals through features like **Animal Companion** (depending on subclass) offers unique roleplaying opportunities, allowing players to portray a Ranger with a deep, spiritual connection to the natural world. This class appeals to players who enjoy themes of nature, survival, and the thrill of the hunt.

Rogues rely on their agility and cunning to stay one step ahead of their enemies, using their signature ability, **Sneak Attack**, to deal massive amounts of damage in a single strike. Whether you want to play a shadowy assassin, a charming thief, or a cunning trickster, the Rogue offers plenty of options for high-risk, high-reward gameplay.

#### Sneak Attack

> Sneak Attack is the Rogue's key combat ability, allowing them to deal extra damage when they have advantage on their attack roll or when an ally is within 5 feet of the target. This extra damage increases as the Rogue levels up, making them deadly in both melee and ranged combat. Sneak Attack encourages Rogues to use tactics and positioning to gain the upper hand in battle, rewarding clever play and careful planning. It’s a powerful feature that defines the Rogue's hit-and-run style of combat.

#### When to Choose This Class

> If you enjoy playing a character who can outmaneuver opponents, strike decisively, and avoid danger, the Rogue is an excellent choice. Rogues are ideal for players who like to be strategic and rely on tactics rather than brute force. Their ability to sneak, disable traps, and deal precision damage makes them highly effective in both combat and exploration-heavy campaigns. Rogues also shine in campaigns with a lot of intrigue, as their stealth, deception, and ability to navigate social situations can give the party an edge in tricky situations.

#### About Rogues

- **Common Lore**: Rogues are often portrayed as resourceful, self-reliant individuals who make a living through stealth, trickery, or crime. They might be thieves, spies, assassins, or scouts, using their skills to survive in a dangerous world. In many stories, Rogues are depicted as lone wolves who prefer to rely on their wits rather than brute strength or magic. While some Rogues operate outside the law, others use their abilities for good, acting as vigilantes or undercover agents. Regardless of their background, Rogues value freedom and often have a strong sense of personal independence.
- **Roleplay**: Rogues can be roleplayed as charming con artists, sneaky assassins, or street-smart adventurers. Their knack for getting out of tough situations gives them plenty of opportunities for clever roleplaying, especially when it comes to navigating traps, infiltrating enemy strongholds, or talking their way out of trouble. Rogues also often have a mysterious or morally ambiguous side, making them intriguing characters in both roleplaying and combat. This class appeals to players who enjoy themes of stealth, deception, and strategy, as well as those who want to play a flexible and cunning character.

## Sorcerer

- **Complexity**: High
- **Spellcaster**: Yes
- **Primary Attributes**: Charisma, Constitution
- **Combat Role**: Spellcasting, Damage Dealer

> Sorcerers are born with innate magical abilities, drawing their power from their bloodline or a unique event in their past that awakened their arcane potential. Unlike other spellcasters, Sorcerers don’t need to study magic—they are magic. Their signature feature, **Sorcery Points**, allows them to manipulate their spells in unique ways, enabling them to cast spells more flexibly than any other class. Sorcerers are known for their destructive power and versatility in manipulating magic.

#### Sorcery Points

> Sorcery Points give Sorcerers the ability to fuel their **Metamagic** options, which allow them to modify their spells in unique ways. For example, they can extend the duration of spells, cast them silently, or even twin spells to target multiple enemies or allies. Sorcery Points can also be converted into additional spell slots or regained from expended spell slots, giving Sorcerers great flexibility in how they use their magic. This resource replenishes after a long rest, making it essential to the Sorcerer’s ability to adapt and customize their spellcasting during combat and exploration.

#### When to Choose This Class

> If you want to play a character with raw magical power and the ability to manipulate spells in unique and creative ways, the Sorcerer is a great choice. Sorcerers are perfect for players who want to focus on damage-dealing, blasting their enemies with powerful spells, but also enjoy a level of versatility that allows them to modify how those spells are cast. They excel in campaigns where magic plays a central role, and where quick thinking and adaptability in spellcasting are crucial. Sorcerers can be powerful damage dealers, but their Metamagic also makes them flexible in any encounter.

#### About Sorcerers

- **Common Lore**: Sorcerers are often depicted as individuals with a natural gift for magic, either through their ancestry or because of some extraordinary event that infused them with arcane power. Unlike wizards who must study magic or warlocks who make pacts with otherworldly beings, Sorcerers' power comes from within. This can make them both feared and revered, as their control over magic is often seen as unpredictable or dangerous. Sorcerers may come from noble bloodlines with arcane ties or may be outcasts, struggling to control the magic that flows through them.
- **Roleplay**: Sorcerers can be roleplayed as characters who are both blessed and cursed by their innate magical abilities. Their magic is often tied to their identity, and they may struggle with controlling it or understanding its source. Sorcerers might feel the weight of responsibility to master their power, or they could embrace their magic as a gift to be wielded however they see fit. The innate nature of their magic can also lead to unique roleplaying opportunities, as they don’t rely on books or patrons but instead draw from something deep within themselves. This class appeals to players who enjoy themes of power, self-discovery, and magical mastery.

## Warlock

- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Spellcaster**: Yes
- **Primary Attributes**: Charisma, Constitution
- **Combat Role**: Spellcasting, Damage Dealer, Support

> Warlocks are spellcasters who have made a pact with a powerful being, such as a fey lord, demon, or ancient entity, in exchange for magical abilities. Their power doesn’t come from study or bloodline but is granted by their **Patron**. This relationship gives Warlocks unique abilities and access to powerful magic, but it often comes with responsibilities or expectations. Warlocks are versatile, with a combination of spells and invocations that can be tailored to a variety of combat or support roles.

#### Eldritch Invocations

> Eldritch Invocations are special abilities granted to Warlocks by their Patron, offering a wide range of magical enhancements. These invocations allow Warlocks to do things like cast spells without using spell slots, see in magical darkness, or improve their physical capabilities. Invocations are central to the Warlock’s versatility, allowing them to customize their playstyle beyond just their spell choices. Some invocations unlock as the Warlock gains levels, making them more powerful as the character’s bond with their Patron deepens.

#### When to Choose This Class

> If you like the idea of playing a character who has made a pact with a mysterious or powerful entity in exchange for magic, the Warlock is an intriguing choice. Warlocks are ideal for players who want a mix of consistent damage with spells like **Eldritch Blast** while also having access to unique spells and abilities through invocations. Warlocks excel in campaigns that focus on themes of power, choice, and the consequences of striking a bargain with a powerful being. They are great for players who enjoy a balance between damage-dealing, spellcasting, and customization.

#### About Warlocks

- **Common Lore**: Warlocks are often depicted as individuals who sought out or were chosen by powerful beings to receive their magical abilities. Unlike wizards who learn their craft or clerics who gain power from devotion, Warlocks’ magic is a direct result of a pact with a Patron. This relationship can vary—some Warlocks are loyal to their Patrons, while others seek to use the powers they've gained for their own ends. Warlocks are frequently viewed with suspicion, as their powers are often linked to otherworldly forces that others may not trust.
- **Roleplay**: Warlocks offer rich roleplaying opportunities due to their pact with their Patron. This relationship can lead to internal conflicts, moral dilemmas, or even direct interactions with their Patron, who might demand certain actions or expect loyalty. Warlocks can be roleplayed as willing servants of their Patron or as reluctant pawns trying to gain as much power as possible while avoiding their Patron's influence. Their pact is a central theme in their identity, often driving their motivations and decisions. This class appeals to players who enjoy themes of power, mystery, and intrigue, as well as the potential for a character arc deeply tied to their Patron.

## Wizard

- **Complexity**: High
- **Spellcaster**: Yes
- **Primary Attributes**: Intelligence, Constitution
- **Combat Role**: Spellcasting, Damage Dealer, Support, Control

> Wizards are masters of arcane knowledge, learning magic through extensive study, practice, and dedication. They have access to the most extensive spell list of any class, allowing them to adapt to nearly any situation. Wizards prepare spells from their spellbook each day, giving them unmatched flexibility and versatility. Their signature feature, **Arcane Recovery**, allows them to regain some spell slots during a short rest, ensuring they remain potent throughout the adventuring day.

#### Arcane Recovery

> Arcane Recovery allows Wizards to recover a number of expended spell slots after a short rest. This feature is invaluable, especially in long adventuring days where resources are stretched thin. As Wizards are primarily reliant on their spells, this ability ensures they can keep casting even after expending their higher-level slots early on. This recovery scales with level, allowing Wizards to regain more spell slots as they grow in power.

#### When to Choose This Class

> If you enjoy playing a character who is all about knowledge, strategy, and casting a wide variety of spells, the Wizard is an excellent choice. Wizards are perfect for players who want to be the brains of the party, solving problems through arcane means, controlling the battlefield, and unleashing devastating spells. Their immense spellbook makes them the most versatile casters, able to handle nearly any challenge, whether it’s combat, exploration, or social encounters. Wizards shine in campaigns where creativity and magical strategy are key.

#### About Wizards

- **Common Lore**: Wizards are often depicted as scholars of the arcane, studying at magical academies or in seclusion, learning the secrets of the universe through ancient tomes and rigorous research. Their power comes from intellect and discipline, not innate ability or pacts with otherworldly entities. Wizards are frequently seen as powerful, yet vulnerable—relying on their spells and wits to survive rather than brute strength. In many cultures, Wizards are revered as advisors, sages, or dangerous individuals who possess knowledge that can alter the fabric of reality.
- **Roleplay**: Wizards offer many opportunities for roleplaying as curious, knowledge-driven individuals who seek to uncover the secrets of magic. Whether you play a character who is obsessed with mastering all forms of magic or one who specializes in a single school of magic, the Wizard’s thirst for learning can drive their motivations. Wizards might be eccentric, absent-minded scholars or calculating and methodical strategists. Their reliance on intelligence makes them natural problem-solvers, and their vast knowledge of spells and lore allows them to be pivotal figures in any adventuring party. This class appeals to players who enjoy themes of knowledge, discovery, and the power of the mind.
