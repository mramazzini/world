### The Most Important Rule: Have Fun

As a Game Master (GM), your number one priority is to ensure that everyone at the table is having fun, including yourself. A great game depends on players feeling comfortable enough to express their ideas and engage with the world you've created.

### Understanding the Social Contract

Being a GM is more than just running a game. It’s about recognizing the social contract between you and your players:

- **Your Role**: You spend time crafting the world, creating exciting scenarios, and facilitating the flow of the game.
- **Their Role**: Players trust you to deliver a good session and engage with the world in good faith.

This mutual trust is the foundation of a successful game. Without it, the game may fall apart.

If players don’t trust you, they may not engage with the world, leading to a lackluster experience for everyone. If you don’t trust your players, you may become overly controlling, stifling their creativity and enjoyment.

### Consistency is Key

The sad reality is, if your sessions aren't fun, your players will eventually lose interest. They may stick around out of courtesy, but ultimately, if they aren’t having fun, they’ll leave. If you want to keep your players engaged, you need to consistently deliver a fun and engaging experience.

### Handling Disruptions

Sometimes, a game may run into issues because of a player’s behavior. As the GM, it’s your job to:

- **Address issues early**: Work with the player to resolve the conflict.
- **Prioritize the group**: If necessary, you may need to remove a player to maintain the integrity of the game.

But remember, disruptions aren’t always the player's fault. Often, player dissatisfaction stems from miscommunication or oversight on the GM’s part. Always reflect on your role in the group dynamic.

## The 5-Step Guide to Running a Great Game

With these principles in mind, let’s dive into the 5-step guide to ensuring your game is a great experience for all players.

### 1. Understand What You Are Walking Into

Being a Game Master involves more than just running a game—it’s a commitment. Here's what you should be prepared for:

- **Hours of Planning**: You’ll spend countless hours planning sessions, creating characters, and building worlds, only for your players to skip over some of it. Be ready to adapt and improvise on the fly as your players engage with unexpected parts of the game.
- **Player Drama**: Conflicts between players are inevitable. You need the maturity to handle disagreements and help keep the atmosphere fun and inclusive for everyone.

- **Scheduling Issues**: Players will cancel, schedules will shift, and things will often be out of your control. Flexibility and patience are key to making sure the game goes on.

- **Rules Disputes**: Occasionally, there will be disagreements about how certain rules are interpreted or applied. Handle these disputes calmly, and make decisions that keep the game moving. Don’t let the game get bogged down by endless debates.

- **Balancing Player Expectations**: Different players will expect different things—some may love combat, others may prefer deep role-playing or puzzles. It’s your job to strike a balance and ensure that each player gets something they enjoy out of the session.

- **Burnout**: Running a game can be mentally and emotionally exhausting, especially if you’re trying to meet high expectations or juggle multiple responsibilities. Make sure to pace yourself and take breaks when needed to avoid burning out and losing the enjoyment of GMing.

- **Sharing Something Special**: Despite the challenges, being a GM is one of the most rewarding experiences. You’ll create and share a unique story with your closest friends, building lasting memories together.

Understand that it’s not always easy, but the rewards far outweigh the difficulties.

### 2. Choose Your Players Wisely

Your players are the heart of your game. **They** determine the story, **they** shape the events, and **they** will dictate what you spend 95% of your time doing. Keep the following in mind when choosing players:

- **Teamwork is Key**: Dungeons & Dragons is a team-based game. You need people who are willing to work together, share the spotlight, and contribute to the story. Lone wolves or players who constantly seek to outshine others can disrupt the group dynamic.

- **Commitment to Time**: D&D is a time commitment. Players need to be able to consistently set aside time to play. If a month goes by without a session, your campaign is on life support. Regular sessions help keep the energy and excitement alive.

- **Maturity Matters**: This is a judgment call, but maturity is crucial. If you're looking for a prolonged campaign, you need players who can handle problems with maturity. They should feel comfortable coming to you with issues rather than causing tension in the game through tantrums or passive-aggressive behavior.

Your players are the backbone of your campaign. Treat them with the highest respect, because their engagement will determine the success of the game just as much as your GM skills.

## 3. Master Scheduling

Scheduling is the most likely thing to kill your game before it even starts. Coordinating multiple players' availability can be tough, but it's essential to the success of your campaign.

### Online vs. In-Person Games

Online games are generally easier to schedule since players don't need to travel, but in-person, home games have their own unique charm. Choose what works best for you and your group, but be aware that either option has its challenges.

### Tools for Scheduling

I recommend using [When2Meet](https://www.when2meet.com/) whenever you're starting a new campaign. Set your availability and send it to your players, asking them to fill it out as well. Encourage flexibility, and remind them that inconsistent scheduling is one of the biggest killers of campaigns.

### Suggested Frequency

A good rule of thumb is to schedule a game **once a week** or **once every two weeks**. Any more than that, and you risk burnout; any less, and the game might fade into obscurity. That said, every group is different, so find the schedule that works best for your team.

### Use Discord for Ongoing Coordination

Create a Discord server for your group and run polls to check availability **one week before** each session. If at least 75% of your players can attend, run the game. Let your players know that there is no ill will if they can't make it for legitimate reasons. Remember, the social contract applies here too: trust that your players want the game to work, but also understand that life happens.

### Addressing Absenteeism

If a player is consistently missing sessions, it becomes an issue you’ll need to address. However, avoid antagonizing players for not being able to attend due to legitimate reasons. If you've chosen your players well and respect them, they’ll reciprocate by letting the group know ahead of time when they can’t make it.

Avoid relying on a single message in a group chat—those often get lost. Instead, use your Discord server or other agreed-upon tools to track attendance properly. That way, you won’t be caught off-guard, and you can plan your session accordingly.

## 4. Make Your World Feel Real

If you want your players to engage with your world, you need to make it feel real and alive. Here are some tips to help you set the scene and immerse your players in the world you’ve created:

### Create Factions

Factions are a great way to give players context for the events in your world. They act as groups that shape the world’s politics, economy, and culture. I like to create about 12 factions, each themed around a class, and embed them into the world.

For example, here’s a faction I made for monks in my **Astral Pirates** campaign:

---

**The Voidfang Brotherhood**

_In stillness, find power; in motion, mastery._

_This faction of astral monks has perfected the art of spiritual and physical balance. They manipulate gravity and momentum in combat, using the void of space as a weapon. Their ships are sleek, fast, and maneuver in ways others cannot._

---

**Tip:** Don’t over-plan the details of the factions. The idea is to give your players a framework to work with and allow them to shape the faction’s history, members, or even name. This makes their characters more deeply embedded in the world, and your players will feel a stronger connection to it.

### Build a Pantheon

The same idea applies to the gods in your world. Create a pantheon of 12-15 deities, defining their domains and inventing some lore. Here’s an example:

---

**Luna** – _Goddess of the Moon, Night, Archery, and the Wild_

**Emblem**: A silver crescent moon surrounded by three stars, with an arrow crossing through the center.

_Luna’s arrows are said to be made of moonlight itself, and only the pure of heart can retrieve them from her sacred forest._

---

Again, don’t get too attached to the specifics. Let your players take these deities and modify them as they like. It’s their game, their world. Your goal is to spark creativity and help them craft characters they connect with.

### Give a General Explanation of the World

Provide your players with a brief overview of the world and its theme. Don’t go overboard with details—let the players fill in the gaps.

For example:

---

**Themes**: High-seas adventure and exploration

_In a vast archipelago of islands and stars, you will sail between worlds, seeking hidden treasures and battling sea (and space) monsters._

---

### Help New Players with Character Creation

Newer players might feel overwhelmed by the vast number of options. Encourage them to reflavor any class, race, or ability to fit the vision they have in their head. Do whatever it takes to ensure they’re playing the character they want to play, and that it fits within your world.

Ask your players to think about:

- **Class**
- **Subclass**
- **Species**
- **Background**
- **Backstory**
- **Two characters** in the world they know or have a connection to.
- **Two flaws** that affect their character.
- **Two personality traits** that define them.
- **Two beliefs or goals** their character holds.

The goal is to encourage them to think about their character’s layers, not to force them into creating a “perfect” character. Ask them guiding questions like:

- _"What does your character want in life?"_
- _"What are they bad at?"_
- _"Who do they know in the world?"_

### Be Supportive

Do not make fun of your players’ answers or choices. Many people struggle with creating a character they like, especially for the first time. Create a space where they feel safe to experiment and get creative without feeling awkward or embarrassed. This will lead to more interesting and dynamic characters.

### Provide Character-Specific Abilities and Items

To make players feel more invested in their characters, give them abilities or magic items tied to their backstory. These personalized rewards make characters feel unique and more integral to the world.

### Mechanics Don't Matter

Your player's will stress over making their character "good" or "optimized." Remind them that the most important thing is that they enjoy playing their character. Mechanics can be adjusted, but a character’s story and personality are what make them memorable.

## 5. The Sessions

### Session 0: Laying the Foundation

Your first session should be a **Session 0**. This is a simple, introductory session where you:

- Introduce the world to the players.
- Help everyone create their characters together as a group.

This gives your players a chance to combine backstories, collaborate, and synergize their party from the start. Make sure they follow the guidelines mentioned in **Step 4** to ensure well-rounded characters.

### Set Some Ground Rules

Establish a few hard rules for your player characters (PCs) right from the start:

1. **No evil characters**: This prevents disruptive "edgelord" behavior.
2. **Each character must have an in-game reason to stay with the party**: This helps avoid lone wolves who derail the campaign.

In addition to character rules, set clear expectations for the group. Every group has different dynamics, but here are some common rules to consider:

- **No romantic advances on other players** unless everyone is comfortable with it.
- **Decide how PvP (player vs. player) moments will work**: Will you allow it, and if so, how will you handle these situations?
- **Set boundaries for uncomfortable topics**: Discuss anything that might make your players uncomfortable, and ensure a safe environment for everyone.
- **Anything else** that you believe needs to be addressed upfront.

### Planning Your Sessions

When it comes to actual sessions, focus on preparing **environments** your players will explore and potential **characters or intriguing locations** they might encounter. Avoid rigidly planning events because this can make players feel railroaded and limit their sense of freedom.

Instead, embrace improvisation. Be flexible and ready to adjust based on what the players do. With practice, you’ll become more comfortable pulling plot points from what’s happening in the moment, allowing for a more organic and engaging narrative.

### Building an Overarching Plot

Always have an overarching plot running in the background. Even if your players don’t actively pursue it, events in the world should continue. This makes the world feel alive and responsive. If your Big Bad Evil Guy (BBEG) has a grand plan, leave breadcrumbs for your players to discover. They can choose to follow the clues, but if they don’t, the consequences of their inaction should be felt.

### Consequences and Player Agency

While consequences for ignoring major plot points are important, they should never be too harsh. The goal is to create tension and get the players' attention, not to stifle their desire to play. Give them room to intervene and affect the story, but always let them know that their actions (or inaction) have weight.

Finding the balance between consequences and player freedom is key to running a dynamic and engaging campaign.

## Conclusion

Being a Game Master is both challenging and rewarding. From world-building and character creation to managing schedules and player dynamics, the role demands flexibility, creativity, and patience. But at the heart of it all, your job is to ensure everyone, including yourself, is having fun. Embrace collaboration, trust your players, and remain open to improvisation. As long as you maintain a welcoming environment and respect the shared storytelling experience, you'll create memorable adventures that keep your players coming back for more. Remember, it's not just your world—it's theirs too. Let them help shape it, and together, you'll tell an unforgettable story.
