# The List

## General changes

This is a list of upcoming changes I plan to add/fix/implement.

- Wild Shape System (something to allow a temporary change of stats)
- Highlight items in inventory by rarity
- Display proficiencies in character sheet
- Character sheet mobile responsiveness
- temp hp system
- tooltips get cutoff by certain containers
- Duration of spells not visible on character sheet
- Allow for delteion of spells
- Spelllists cannot be middle clicked to open in new tab
- Remove proficiencies from options when choosing proficency if character is already proficient
- OAuth (log in with google)
- Custom Weapon attacks (like unarmed strike)
- Custom Armor (like natural armor) + Armor override option
- Spell slots do not persist on page reload
- Features list reshuffles when casting a spell (I have no idea why)
- When adding a spell, you can have 0d4 rolls, and there is no way to remove them
- Allow moving around the order of spells in spelllist
- If you don't pick all choices on character creation and reload the page, you can't pick the choices, even though they are still there. The only fix right now is to reset the character.

## Features Update

The features update looks to update how some features are displayed and interact with your character

  - Fighting Styles
