## Major Update

- Character Sheet is now _mostly_ functional for level 1 characters
- Character sheet has the following features:

  - Sheet Tab

    - Roll log to keep track of previous rolls
    - Ability Score Roller
    - Hit Point Manager
    - Info Tab including Armor Class, Passive Perception, and Speed auto-calculated
    - Skill Rollers
    - Saving Throw Rollers
    - Spellcasting info + Spell Attack Roller
    - Tool Section to roll relevant tool checks
    - Weapon Section to roll weapon attacks
    - Spell Section to roll Spell Damage Rolls
    - A consolidated list of all features gained from Class, subclass, race, subrace, and background.

  - Inventory Tab

    - Add and remove items from inventory
    - Unpack Equipment Packs
    - Equip Armor or shields to automatically increase your AC
    - Equip Weapons to have them appear in your weapon section in the Sheet Tab
    - Carrying Capacity
    - Item Previewer to see what an item does
    - List of all features that your items grant you

  - Spells Tab

    - Add spells to your prepared spell list to have them appear in the Spell Section in the Sheet Tab
    - For now you need to manually input your spell information (like damage, range, components etc.), until I automate it.

  - Traits Tab

    - A About section to write a bio of your character
    - A Personality section to list your character's personality traits
    - A Bonds section to list your character's bonds
    - A Flaws section to list your character's flaws
    - An Ideals section to list your character's ideals
    - Write all these in markdown for easy formatting

  - Notes Tab

    - A notes section to write down any notes you want to keep track of
    - Write in markdown for easy formatting

  - Choices tab

    - Sometimes you need to make choices about what your character will gain at a certain level. This tab will keep track of those choices, and prompt you to make them when you level up. For example, at level 1, you have to choose your starting items for each class. When you select those items, they will appear in your inventory. The same goes for Skill, tool, weapon and language proficiencies. Currently, ability score improvements are not implemented.

  - Demos
